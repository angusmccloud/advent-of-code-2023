## Some notes when developing
Testing a function: 
- Test files should use the test.txt files, which is the sample data from AOC
- AOC gives expected results
- Then run this to see if your Calculate function is working properly: `npx jest --watch app/day1/part1.test.js`
- There's a sample setup in day 1 (hopefully more days by the time you see this)
